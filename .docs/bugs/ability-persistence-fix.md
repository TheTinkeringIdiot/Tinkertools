# Ability Value Persistence Bug Fix

**Date:** 2025-09-13
**Severity:** High
**Components:** TinkerProfiles - Ability Management

## Problem Description

Ability values modified through the TinkerProfiles UI were not persisting across page refreshes. Users would adjust ability points (Strength, Agility, Intelligence, etc.) in their character profiles, but these changes would be lost when the page was reloaded or the application was restarted.

## Root Causes

Two separate bugs were causing this issue:

### 1. Incorrect Breed Base Value Calculation

**File:** `frontend/src/lib/tinkerprofiles/ip-integrator.ts:448`

The `modifyAbility` function was incorrectly calculating the breed base value for abilities:

```typescript
// INCORRECT (before fix)
const breedBase = getBreedId(profile.Character.Breed) || 6; // Default base

// CORRECT (after fix)
const breedBase = getBreedInitValue(breed, abilityStatId);
```

**Impact:** This caused incorrect IP (Improvement Point) cost calculations and wrong ability improvement values to be stored in the profile.

### 2. Missing Async/Await for Profile Save

**File:** `frontend/src/stores/tinkerProfiles.ts:718`

The store was calling the `modifyAbility` function without awaiting its completion:

```typescript
// INCORRECT (before fix)
const result = modifyAbility(profile, abilityName, newValue);

// CORRECT (after fix)
const result = await modifyAbility(profile, abilityName, newValue);
```

**Impact:** The profile update operation would not wait for the ability modification to complete, causing race conditions and preventing the changes from being properly saved to localStorage.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Fixed breed base value calculation** by using the correct `getBreedInitValue(breed, abilityStatId)` function instead of incorrectly using `getBreedId()` as the base value.

2. **Added proper async handling** by adding the `await` keyword when calling `modifyAbility` from the store, ensuring the operation completes before proceeding with profile updates.

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/lib/tinkerprofiles/ip-integrator.ts` - Fixed breed base value calculation
- `frontend/src/stores/tinkerProfiles.ts` - Added missing await for async operation

## Testing Notes

After these fixes:

1. **Ability modifications persist** - Changes made to abilities through the UI are now properly saved and remain after page refresh
2. **IP costs calculate correctly** - The improvement point costs are now calculated using the correct breed base values
3. **No race conditions** - The async operation properly completes before profile state updates

## Validation Steps

To verify the fix:

1. Open TinkerProfiles and create or load a character profile
2. Modify any ability value (Strength, Agility, etc.)
3. Refresh the page or navigate away and back
4. Confirm the ability value change persists
5. Verify IP costs are calculated correctly based on breed base values
