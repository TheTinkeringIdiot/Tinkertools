# Database Setup (Task 1 Placeholder)

Alembic is selected for migrations. Migrations will be initialized in Task 2.

Local async PostgreSQL URL format (as referenced in backend/.env.example):
postgresql+asyncpg://tinker_user:dev_password@localhost:5432/tinker_tools

Notes:
- Create the database/user in your local Postgres before running the backend.
- No DDL is included in Task 1; schema and migration setup will be handled in Task 2.
