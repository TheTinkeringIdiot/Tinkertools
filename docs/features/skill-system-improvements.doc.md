# TinkerProfiles Skill System Improvements

## Overview

This feature represents a comprehensive enhancement to the TinkerProfiles skill calculation system, focusing on accurate IP integration, AC calculation improvements, and better Misc skill handling. The changes span 20+ files with significant improvements to skill value calculations, UI components, and bonus application mechanisms.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced IP Integration for Misc Skills
- **Problem**: Misc skills were not properly receiving equipment, perk, and buff bonuses
- **Solution**: Enhanced `ip-integrator.ts` with dedicated Misc skill bonus application (lines 363-381)
- **Impact**: Misc skills like "Max NCU", "Add All Off.", etc. now correctly display all bonuses

### 2. AC Calculation Overhaul
- **Problem**: AC values were accumulating bonuses on each update, causing incorrect values
- **Solution**:
  - New dedicated `ac-calculator.ts` utility for on-the-fly calculations
  - ACs now calculated from pure bonuses (no base value) to prevent accumulation bugs
  - Enhanced `SkillSlider.vue` to handle AC-specific display logic (lines 261-267)
- **Impact**: AC values are now accurate and don't drift over time

### 3. Improved Skill Mapping and Storage
- **Problem**: Inconsistent skill name matching and stats mapping
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced `profile-stats-mapper.ts` with 235 lines of improvements
  - New `skill-patterns.ts` utility with regex-based flexible skill matching
  - Better handling of skill name variations and abbreviations
- **Impact**: More reliable skill identification across different data sources

### 4. UI Component Enhancements
- **Problem**: Skill sliders lacked proper Misc skill support and bonus visualization
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced `SkillSlider.vue` with 108 additional lines of improvements
  - Better tooltip breakdowns showing all bonus sources
  - Improved equipment bonus indicators with visual feedback
  - Enhanced support for read-only Misc skills and ACs
- **Impact**: Better user experience with clearer skill value breakdowns

### 5. Service Layer Improvements
- **Problem**: Equipment, nano, and perk bonus calculators had edge cases and inconsistencies
- **Solution**:
  - Updated all three bonus calculator services with consistency improvements
  - Better error handling and null-value protection
  - Enhanced integration with the IP system
- **Impact**: More reliable bonus calculations across all systems

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. **Profile Loading**: Skills loaded with base values and IP contributions
2. **Bonus Calculation**: Equipment, perk, and buff bonuses calculated separately
3. **Value Integration**: All bonuses applied via `updateProfileSkillInfo()` in ip-integrator
4. **UI Display**: Skill components show breakdown of all value sources
5. **AC Special Handling**: ACs calculated on-the-fly to prevent accumulation

### Key Files Modified

#### Core Logic (8 files)

- `frontend/src/utils/skill-patterns.ts` - **New** flexible skill pattern matching

#### UI Components (7 files)
- `frontend/src/components/profiles/skills/SkillSlider.vue` - Major UI enhancements
- `frontend/src/components/profiles/skills/SkillsManager.vue` - Improved skill management
- `frontend/src/components/profiles/skills/SkillCategory.vue` - Better category handling
- `frontend/src/components/profiles/skills/SkillsGrid.vue` - Enhanced grid display

- `frontend/src/services/perk-bonus-calculator.ts` - Better perk bonus extraction

#### Supporting Infrastructure (2+ files)
- `frontend/src/stores/tinkerProfiles.ts` - Store integration improvements
- `frontend/src/lib/tinkerprofiles/constants.ts` - Updated constants
- `frontend/src/lib/tinkerprofiles/skill-mappings.ts` - Enhanced mappings
- Plus test files and type definitions

## User-Facing Changes

### Before
- Misc skills showed only base values (equipment/perk bonuses ignored)
- AC values would drift and accumulate incorrectly over time
- Skill tooltips provided limited breakdown information
- Some skills had inconsistent naming/mapping issues

### After
- **Complete Bonus Integration**: All skills (including Misc) show correct totals
- **Accurate AC Values**: ACs calculated fresh each time, no accumulation bugs
- **Detailed Tooltips**: Skill breakdowns show Base + Trickle-down + IP + Equipment + Perks + Buffs
- **Visual Indicators**: Equipment bonuses highlighted with color-coded icons
- **Better Consistency**: Improved skill identification and mapping across the system

## Testing Considerations

### Critical Test Cases
1. **Misc Skill Bonuses**: Verify "Max NCU", "Add All Off.", etc. include all bonuses
2. **AC Accumulation**: Ensure AC values don't drift when equipment changes repeatedly
3. **Skill Tooltips**: Check tooltip breakdowns show all contributing factors
4. **Profile Loading**: Verify skills load correctly from stored profiles
5. **Equipment Changes**: Confirm bonuses update immediately when equipment changes

### Performance Impact
- **Positive**: ACs now calculated on-demand (no storage overhead)
- **Neutral**: Misc skill bonus calculation adds minimal overhead
- **Optimized**: Better skill pattern matching reduces lookup times

## Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements
- **Skill Templates**: Pre-configured skill builds for different professions
- **Bonus Optimization**: Suggestions for equipment combinations
- **Advanced Tooltips**: Graphical bonus breakdown charts

### Breaking Changes
- AC values stored in profiles will be ignored (calculated fresh)
- Misc skill bonus fields added to profile structure
- Skill mapping patterns may affect custom skill name handling

## Dependencies

### Internal
- Requires IP calculation system (`ip-calculator.ts`)
- Uses game data services for skill/stat mappings
- Integrates with equipment, perk, and nano bonus systems

### External
- PrimeVue components for UI enhancements
- Vue 3 reactivity system for real-time updates
- TypeScript for enhanced type safety

## Summary

This comprehensive skill system improvement addresses three major pain points: Misc skill bonus integration, AC calculation accuracy, and skill identification consistency. The changes provide users with accurate skill values, detailed tooltips, and reliable calculations while maintaining the existing IP-based skill progression system.

The improvements are particularly important for high-level characters where equipment and perk bonuses represent significant portions of total skill values, and where AC values are critical for survivability calculations.
